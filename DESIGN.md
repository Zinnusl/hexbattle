# HexBattle: Real-Time Network Strategy

## Game Concept
HexBattle is a real-time strategy game where players build and manage networks of interconnected nodes to gather resources, defend territory, and attack opponents. The game emphasizes quick thinking and adaptive strategy in a dynamic battlefield.

## Core Mechanics
1. **Network Building**
   - Players create networks by connecting nodes
   - Each node can be specialized for different purposes:
     * Resource nodes generate energy
     * Defense nodes protect nearby connections
     * Attack nodes can target enemy networks
   - Networks must be connected to function

2. **Resource Management**
   - Energy flows through network connections
   - Longer connections require more energy
   - Nodes consume energy based on their specialization
   - Disconnected nodes become inactive

3. **Combat System**
   - Attack nodes can target enemy connections
   - Defense nodes create protective fields
   - Strategic positioning is key to network defense
   - Destroyed connections can be rebuilt

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Network Mechanics**
   - Node connection system
   - Energy flow simulation
   - Node specialization system

2. **Phase 2: Combat**
   - Attack and defense mechanics
   - Network damage system
   - Real-time interaction

3. **Phase 3: Balance & Polish**
   - Resource balance tuning
   - Visual feedback systems
   - Network efficiency indicators

## Unique Features
- Dynamic resource management
- Real-time strategic decisions
- Multiple viable strategies
- Focus on network efficiency
