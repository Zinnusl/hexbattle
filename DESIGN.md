# HexBattle: Territory Control Puzzle

## Game Concept
HexBattle is a strategic puzzle game where players must connect hexagonal tiles to create and control territories while preventing opponents from doing the same. The game combines elements of Go and Hex with a unique territory-building mechanic.

## Core Mechanics
1. **Territory Building**
   - Players connect hexagonal nodes to form enclosed territories
   - A territory is formed when a complete loop of connections is made
   - Larger territories are worth more points
   - Territories can be nested inside other territories

2. **Connection Rules**
   - Connections cannot cross existing connections
   - Each node can have up to 6 connections (hexagonal grid)
   - Players must complete territories to score points

3. **Scoring System**
   - Points awarded based on territory size
   - Bonus points for creating nested territories
   - Strategic blocking of opponent's potential territories

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Basic Mechanics**
   - Implement hexagonal grid system
   - Add node connection logic
   - Develop territory detection algorithm

2. **Phase 2: Scoring & Validation**
   - Territory size calculation
   - Score tracking system
   - Valid move validation

3. **Phase 3: AI & Polish**
   - Basic AI opponent
   - Visual feedback for valid/invalid moves
   - Tutorial system

## Unique Features
- Dynamic territory values based on position and size
- Multiple valid strategies (small quick territories vs large risky ones)
- Perfect information puzzle gameplay
