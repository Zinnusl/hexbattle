# HexBattle: Puzzle Platformer Network

## Game Concept
HexBattle combines puzzle and platformer elements where players control a character navigating through hexagonal networks while manipulating connections to create paths and solve challenges. The game emphasizes both strategic thinking and timing-based gameplay.

## Core Mechanics
1. **Character Movement**
   - Character can move along network connections
   - Jump between nearby unconnected nodes
   - Special abilities unlock as game progresses
   - Momentum-based movement system

2. **Network Manipulation**
   - Create and remove connections in real-time
   - Limited number of connections available
   - Connections can be temporary or permanent
   - Special node types with unique properties:
     * Bounce nodes
     * Speed boost nodes
     * Teleport nodes

3. **Level Design**
   - Progressive difficulty curve
   - Multiple solution paths
   - Time-based challenges
   - Hidden collectibles requiring clever network manipulation
